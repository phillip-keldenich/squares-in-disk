# Packing Squares into a Disk with Optimal Worst-Case Density: Automatic Proofs
This repository contains the code for the automatic proofs of our paper 

> Packing Squares into a Disk with Optimal Worst-Case Density

submitted to SODA 2021.

## Getting and Building the Code
The code makes use of our interval arithmetic prover framework at 

> https://gitlab.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/alg/ivarp.git

that is included as a copy in this repository.

## Further Dependencies
The code depends on the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP, see https://gmplib.org/) and the 
GNU Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliable Library (MPFR, see https://www.mpfr.org/).

These LGPL-licensed open source libraries are not included in this repository and are not developed by us.
On Unix-like systems (Linux, MacOS), these libraries can be obtained by package
managers (like apt for Ubuntu or HomeBrew for MacOS).
On Windows, building these libraries from source code is not officially supported;
there are, however, forks of these libraries (under the name MPIR, see http://mpir.org/), for which
Visual Studio projects are available.

Furthermore, the code also depends on (the header-only part of) the open source Boost C++ libraries (see https://www.boost.org/).
Like the other libraries, these are not included in this repository and are not developed by us.

## Building the Code
The code is built using the CMake Cross-Platform Make toolkit available at https://cmake.org/ .

On a Unix-like system, building typically consists of the following sequence of commands (within the root directory of the repository).

    mkdir cmake-build-release && cd cmake-build-release
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    make

Compilation may take quite some time.
These commands should generate an executable running the proof at `${PROJECT_ROOT}/cmake-build-release/src/squares_in_disk_prover`.

## Running the Code
The executable `squares_in_disk_prover` can be run without command line arguments.

### Example Output
The output of the program contains informs about the progress of the prover and the number of individual hypercuboids considered.
